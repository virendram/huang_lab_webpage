            <h2><a id="Research Project 1">1. Anatomical Development of Human Fetal Brain with high resolution diffusion tensor imaging</a></h2>
            <p>Delineating the anatomical changes of human fetal brain is essential to understand the complicated yet highly organized process of brain development. As complex as the human brain is, its origin is a simple tubular structure. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is noninvasive, three-dimensional and requires relatively less imaging time to characterize the entire brain anatomy with the modern scanners. Digital character of DTI data makes it easily distributed and used as the anatomical reference for developmental study in both basic neuroscience and clinical diagnosis. Hence, the comprehensive digital 2D/3D qualitative and quantitative structural information from DTI/MRI fills a gap in our knowledge on developmental human brains. It provides anatomical details not only on the macrostructural morphology, but also microstructural organization of the developing cerebral cortex and white matter. For details, please see our publications (Huang et al., Neuroimage 2006; Huang et al., Journal of Neuroscience 2009; Huang et al., Cerebral Cortex 2013).<br><br> We are the consortium member of BrainSpan project. <a href="http://www.brainspan.org/">(BrainSpan)</a>.</p>

            <h2><a id="Research Project 2">2. Connectome of developmental brains</a></h2>
            <p>During human brain development through infancy and childhood, microstructural and macrostructural changes take place to reshape the brain&#39;s structural networks and better adapt them to sophisticated functional and cognitive requirements. However, structural topological configuration of the human brain during this specific development period is not well understood. In this study, diffusion magnetic resonance image (dMRI) of 25 neonates, 13 toddlers and 25 pre-adolescents were acquired to characterize network dynamics at these three landmark cross&#45;sectional ages during early childhood. dMRI tractography was used to construct human brain structural networks and the underlying topological properties were quantified by graph&#45;theory approaches. Modular organization and small&#45;world attributes are evident at birth with several important topological metrics increasing monotonically during development. Most significant increases of regional nodes occur in the posterior cingulate cortex which plays a pivotal role in functional default&#45;mode network. Positive correlations exist between nodal efficiencies and fractional anisotropy of the white matter traced from these nodes, while correlation slopes vary among the brain regions. These results reveal substantial topological reorganization of human brain structural networks through infancy and childhood, which is likely to be the outcome of both heterogeneous strengthening of the major white&#45;matter tracts and pruning of other axonal fibers.

            <p>Due to their close relationship to the human brain, rhesus macaque <i>(Macaca mulatta)</i> models have been unique and irreplaceable for answering fundamental questions on the brain functions. The neuroanatomical atlases play essentials role for brain&#45;related research in multiple aspects, finding and identifying the unknown structures based on known ones, guiding the invasive operations, carrying the knowledge of brain structures for education and serving as registration references for mapping the functional information. Currently available macaque atlases based on histology and conventional T1 weighted MRI or chemical tracing have played important roles as anatomical references. However, few of them are digital, comprehensive including anatomical information of cortical gyri, subcortical nuclei and white matter tracts, established in in vivo space or have 3D presentations. DTI characterizing the white matter anatomy of human brain can be potentially used for establishing comprehensive digital atlas of macaque brain.  </p>

            <h2><a id="Research Project 4">4. TSFA (Tract-Specific Fractional Anisotropy) at crossing-fiber regions with clinical diffusion MRI</a></h2>
            <p>To accommodate complex &#34;wiring&#34; in the human brain with a volume of around 1.2 liters, a significant percentage of white matter (WM) fibers need to cross with each other. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) in routine clinical research is usually acquired within a limited time of less than 5 minutes and with a relatively low b-value such as 1000s/mm&sup2;. The resultant voxel size is usually from 2x2x2mm3 to 3x3x3mm3 and crossing fibers exist in a large proportion of WM voxels. It is believed that almost half of the brain voxels contain crossing fibers. Fractional anisotropy (FA) derived from the single tensor model and ranging from 0 to 1, has been widely used to infer the WM microstructural changes associated with many neurological or psychiatric disorders. However, single tensor FA is significantly underestimated at the crossing-fiber regions. In addition, tract-specific analyses including tract statistics, tract-morphometry and tract-metric analysis have become important due to great clinical significance of the tracts. With the extensive applications of FA in neurological and psychiatric studies such as phenotype characterization, drug testing and therapy monitoring, biased conclusions from the underestimated single tensor FA in tract analysis will have significant negative impacts on these studies. It is, therefore, critical to correct FA at the crossing-fiber regions for the effects of free water and crossing-fiber geometry and obtain the tract-specific FA (TSFA) for each crossed tract with routine clinical dMRI, namely single shell dMRI with 25-30 diffusion orientations.

            <h3><a id="Research Project 5.1">5.1 Tract level analysis</a></h3>
            <p>DTI-derived metrics, fractional anisotropy (FA), has been widely used to detect subtle structural white matter abnormalities. Conventional VBM (voxel-based-morphometry) approaches delineate the abnormality at the voxel level. However, information reflected from a single voxel of the brain image cannot be used to evaluate the clinical condition of the patient. It is the whole white matter tracts connecting different brain regions that have clinical importance. In this study, the targeted unit is the functional white matter tract incorporating continuous and multiple voxels rather than the individual voxel in a brain image. We developed a method to survey all white matter tracts by mapping the labeling of a digital atlas to the core white matter of the subjects and applied it to Alzheimer disease (AD). With no a priori information, this novel tract analysis approach has been used to examine all 50 major white matter tracts of AD patients and age-matched controls at the tract level. The proposed method is highly efficient, accurate, makes comprehensive examination of all major tracts and allows comparison of disruption level of these tracts. With the analysis of AD results, we found that white matter disruption in AD brains is heterogeneous, widespread, and affects the fornix most severely.

            <h2><a id="Research Project 6">6. Regional changes of cortical mean diffusivities with aging and Alzheimer's disease after correction of partial volume effects</a></h2>
            <p>Accurately measuring the cortical mean diffusivity (MD) derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) at the comprehensive lobe, gyral and voxel level of the young, elderly healthy brains and those with Alzheimer's disease (AD) may provide insights on heterogeneous cortical microstructural changes caused by aging and AD. Due to partial volume effects (PVE), the measurement of cortical MD is overestimated with contamination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The bias is especially severe for aging and AD brains because of significant cortical thinning of these brains. In this study, we aimed to quantitatively characterize the unbiased regional cortical MD changes due to aging and AD and delineate the effects of cortical thinning of elderly healthy and AD groups on MD measurements. Our study suggests that the cortical thinning in elderly healthy and AD groups is a significant contributor to the bias of uncorrected cortical MD measurement. The established comprehensive unbiased cortical MD profiles of young, elderly healthy subjects and AD patients at the lobe, gyral and voxel level may serve as clinical references for cortical microstructure.
